### Technical skills chart ###

This is a chart of the technical skills I have used over my career. This chart is interactive, to see it change either click along the top curve, on the skills themselves or on the bottom lines.

The top circumfrence is the types of skills I have used, the horizontal blocks along the bottom are the places where the skills were used and the circles are the skills.
